        <h2 class="coreHeading"> What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning? </h2>
        <p class="coreParagraph"> 
        1. I have learnt that I have the capability to learn things and absorb plenty of new information in a short period of time. 
        <br><br>
        2. I have learnt that our brain is really powerful. When you set your mind in doing something, no matter the circumstances, you can achieve what you want to achieve.
        <br><br>
        3. I have learnt that having to reach out for help isn’t so bad. I have mentioned this in my previous reflections that I am used to working alone although I believe I also work well in a team but if I was given an option then I would prefer to work alone. During foundations, one of my facilitator pushed me to reach out for help. It was daunting at the beginning but it was not so bad after all and is really helpful.

        <h2 class="coreHeading"> What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming? </h2>
        <p class="coreParagraph"> You need to have self-awareness in learning and programming because it is important to know yourself and be aware of your capabilities and strengths so you can maximize them for your full potential. Having values is also as important because your values are like your tools in making good decisions by simply applying your values to the new challenges that come along. On the other hand, empathy is needed to be able to work with others who learn and think differently. Feeling understood and supported would help us stay motivated and encourage to advocate for ourselves.

          <h2 class="coreHeading">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
          </h2>
          <p class="coreParagraph"> I was surprised to learn that it is a crucial part of learning programming. I always had the impression that programming is mostly technical. I didn’t expect that Dev Academy would also focus and allot a lot of time for the core learning but I realised that it is as important to be able to succeed in this kind of field because in order for you to succeed you need to be equipped with the soft kills and not just the technical skills side of things. 
          </p>
      <div>
          <h2 class="coreHeading"> What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning? </h2>
          <p class="coreParagraph"> The most challenging parts of core learning is having to think of an analogy in trying to explain a certain concept. It required a deep understanding of the new concept and having to incorporate it using your own examples is challenging.

      <div>
          <h2 class="coreHeading">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
          </h2>
          <p class="coreParagraph"> Core skills are the essential skills that we need to be fully prepared in life and when we go out to the industry. Employers will not only be looking for highly skilled employees but also this who exhibit human skills as well. Having a set of soft skills allow organizations to effectively and efficiently use their technical skills without being disrupted by potential interpersonal issues. Some research say that employers are looking for the right blend of technical and soft skills as one of their strategic approach.

      <div>
        <h2 class="coreHeading"> Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer. </h2>
        <p class="coreParagraph"> I don’t feel like it’s a waste of time because I needed to learn these concepts. I especially liked the topic on neuroplasticity and growth mindset. It was my first time learning about these concepts and it has strengthened my belief that I could finish this course. At times, when the thought of giving up pops in my head, I remember these concepts and I am reminded that I my brain is capable of learning and absorbing new information and it will eventually be wired into my brains and that if I only think of going upwards then those things will manifest naturally.

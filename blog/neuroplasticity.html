      <h2 class="coreHeading"> How does understanding principles of Neuroplasticity benefit people?
      </h2>
      <p class="coreParagraph"> Neuroplasticity is the ability of our brains to learn new things. It’s our brain’s malleability in response to our behavior and environment. Understanding this would help us engage in activities that will contribute to our holistic well-being no matter our age. To illustrate an example, let’s look at how our education system works. Our normal perception of a perfect timeline would be attending pre-school, elementary, secondary, tertiary then post-graduate for some. After that, we are expected to join the workforce. On some occasions, a person might want to have a change in career in his 40s. This is not something we see normally. You might doubt that you are past the age of attending school to learn a new course. When you understand the concept of neuroplasticity then you will realise that it’s never too late to learn and that our brains will have the capacity to enhance existing cognitive capabilities.

        <h2 class="coreHeading"> How will I engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my benefit?
        </h2>
        <p class="coreParagraph"> I am actually engaging the concept of neuroplasticity at the moment by doing this course. I have not been in school for the past 7 years and have not been working for almost 2 years since I had our baby. I thought that my brain does not have enough mental exercises since I am only focused on taking care of our baby. However, now that I am doing this web development course, I feel like my brain cells are working extra hard to retain new information. I believe that I can get smarter, better or more skilled at this through sustained effort.

        <p class="coreParagraph"> You can try these activities to rewire your brain: 
        <br>
        <br>
          1.Play video games - when you play a new game, you teach your brain new skills. Benefits associated with gaming include motor coordination, visual recognition, memory and reaction time, resilience and team participation. 
          <br>
          <br>
          2. Learn a new language - this improves the gray areas in your brain that are associated with language, attention, memory, emotions and motor skills. It is believed that bilingualism may offer some protection against cognitive decline. 
          <br>
          <br>
          3. Make some music - this helps improve your mood, concentration and focus. Also your ability to learn and remember new information.
          <br>
          <br>
          4. Travel - this may help enhance cognitive flexibility, inspire you, and enhance creativity. By seeing a different place, it will broaden your general view of the world which might help you become a better communicator. 
          <br>
          <br>
          5. Exercise - can lead to improvements in cognitive abilities like learning and memory. This also helps improve fine motor coordination and brain connectivity. 
          <br>
          <br>
          6.Make art - artistic pursuits can help create new pathways and strengthen existing connections in your brain, leading to better cognitive function overall. 
          <br> 
          <br>      
          Trying out these activities with a bit of time and patience can rewire your brain. This may in turn help with mental health and protect against cognitive decline.

        <h2 class="coreHeading"> What is a growth mindset? And why is it important? 
        </h2>
        <p class="coreParagraph"> A growth mindset is a term we often associate with education, especially when we look for ways to improve in our academics. It is believed that intelligence and abilities can be developed through hard work and dedication. Having this kind of mindset will make you realise that you can improve or learn more when you work hard for it. 
          <br>
          <br>
          It is important because it can help you surpass difficulties that comes with learning something new or when you are trying to develop a new skill. Having a growth mindset will instill the importance of perseverance and determination. The way you think greatly affects the way you learn. Self-doubting yourself will inhibit your capability of enhancing your talents and intelligence which will allow you to explore, experience and achieve more.

      <h2 class="coreHeading"> My long term goal or career pathway </h2>
      <p class="coreParagraph"> My long-term goal is to be able to build a career as a web developer. I want to gain expertise in  domain, technology or language. Hopefully, I would land a job that has room for growth, lower risk of being redundant and have a higher satisfaction overall.

        <h2 class="coreHeading"> Strengths and limitations when it comes to learning </h2>
        <p class="coreParagraph"> One of my strengths is that I can focus on my tasks and I persevere to finish them. I also manage my time well. One of my limitations when it comes to learning is that I have a baby to take care of. As much as I want to spend as much time as possible studying, I also have to give ample time for my baby.

          <h2 class="coreHeading"> Human skills I would like to develop while at Dev Academy </h2>
        <p class="coreParagraph"> The non-technical skills I would want to develop in my learning journey here at Dev Academy are effective communication skills, the ability to self-learn and be creative and overcome fallbacks. I hope that I gain more confidence in communicating and expressing myself with others. I hope to learn to be creative and think outside of the box. Most importantly, I need to learn to accept that I will fall into the rabbit hole a lot of times but I need to keep going until I reach my goals.

          <div>
            <h2 class="coreHeading"> A commitment on how I will manage my workload in this programme </h2>
          <p class="coreParagraph"> I commit to setting aside an ample amount of hours daily to learn and finish my tasks. I will keep my communication lines open and to keep on checking discord for any important messages or announcements. When things start to build up and get the best of me, I will step back and stop for a while to refresh and come back ready to try again. 
            </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2 class="coreHeading"> A commitment as to how and where to seek help in a timely way</h2>
            <p class="coreParagraph"> When I get stuck, I will look back on previous resources,  research for more information online or check the relevant threads in discord because there might be someone who already asked the same query. If I still don’t get it, I will ask my fellow classmates and facilitators for help. 
              </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h2 class="coreHeading"> What I expect from my facilitators</h2>
              <p class="coreParagraph"> I expect the facilitators to communicate with us and guide us through by having a couple of check-ups or catch-ups to see where we are in our learning. Also to support us by constantly providing feedback on our works. 
                </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <h2 class="coreHeading"> Scheduling information and other commitments</h2>
                <p class="coreParagraph"> I don’t specifically have a schedule information but as I mentioned above I have a one year old boy under my care. However, at this time my husband is taking care of him most of the time and our parents are also around to give a hand. It’s just that there will be times that I need to attend to my baby, especially that we are still on pure breastfeeding.

        <h2 class="coreHeading"> My long term goal or career pathway </h2>
        <p class="coreParagraph"> I still have the same long term plan to be able to build a career as a web developer. I want to gain skills and knowledge needed to be a successful one. That includes having the knowledge of computer and software systems and have the proper skills in programming languages and techniques that keep up with current developments and demands of the industry. </p>

      <div>
        <h2 class="coreHeading"> Strengths and limitations in Bootcamp </h2>
        <p class="coreParagraph"> One of my strengths is perseverance and focus which I mentioned in Sprint2. I believed it has helped me a lot during foundations and hopefully will be enough during bootcamp. Although I think I will need to work on my time management skills more. One of my limitations that I mentioned was having to take care of my baby whilst complying with the requirements during foundations which really gave me a hard time. During bootcamp, I have prepared myself to spend less time with my family for the whole duration of it and I think this will enable me to focus more and manage my time well with school requirements.

      <div>
          <h2 class="coreHeading"> Biggest non-technical challenge in bootcamp</h2>
          <p class="coreParagraph"> I think my biggest non-technical challenge in bootcamp will be having to pair with different people everyday for pair programming and speaking infant of the group. I haven’t been around people or merely talked with a lot of people over the pandemic and after having the baby so I may be a little uncomfortable but I know I will get used to it again since I have years of experience around customer service and teaching.           </p>
      </div>
      <div>
          <h2 class="coreHeading"> Non-technical skills - human skills - I like to see developed in myself while at Dev Academy </h2>
          <p class="coreParagraph"> II would like for my communication skills and the ability to pair with different people for a project enhanced. I sometimes struggle to express my thoughts given that English is my second language and I would like to be able to be comfortable conversing in this medium again. I believe having to pair program on a daily basis and being in teams all the time will help me build on those skills.

      <div>
          <h2 class="coreHeading"> Expectations from Bootcamp team</h2>
          <p class="coreParagraph"> When I get stuck, I will look back on previous resources,  research for more information online or check the relevant threads in discord because there might be someone who already asked the same query. If I still don’t get it, I will ask my fellow classmates and facilitators for help. 
          </p>
      </div>
      <div>
          <h2 class="coreHeading"> What I expect from myself at bootcamp</h2>
          <p class="coreParagraph"> I expect myself to be more focused and present and finish that is required given the allotted time. I also would try my very best to instantly reach out for help and not let myself fall behind. I would also like to get the most out of very check-in session and express my concerns. I promise to work harmoniously with my co-students, facilitators and other industry representatives.

        <h2 class="coreHeading"> My long term goal or career pathway </h2>
        <p class="coreParagraph"> My long-term goal is to be able to build a career as a web developer. I want to gain expertise in  domain, technology or language. Hopefully, I would land a job that has room for growth, lower risk of being redundant and have a higher satisfaction overall.

      <div>
        <h2 class="coreHeading"> Strengths and limitations when it comes to learning </h2>
        <p class="coreParagraph"> One of my strengths is that I can focus on my tasks and I persevere to finish them. I also manage my time well. One of my limitations when it comes to learning is that I have a baby to take care of. As much as I want to spend as much time as possible studying, I also have to give ample time for my baby.

      <div>
        <h2 class="coreHeading"> Human skills I would like to develop while at Dev Academy </h2>
        <p class="coreParagraph"> The non-technical skills I would want to develop in my learning journey here at Dev Academy are effective communication skills, the ability to self-learn and be creative and overcome fallbacks. I hope that I gain more confidence in communicating and expressing myself with others. I hope to learn to be creative and think outside of the box. Most importantly, I need to learn to accept that I will fall into the rabbit hole a lot of times but I need to keep going until I reach my goals. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 class="coreHeading"> A commitment on how I will manage my workload in this programme </h2>
        <p class="coreParagraph"> I commit to setting aside an ample amount of hours daily to learn and finish my tasks. I will keep my communication lines open and to keep on checking discord for any important messages or announcements. When things start to build up and get the best of me, I will step back and stop for a while to refresh and come back ready to try again. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 class="coreHeading"> A commitment as to how and where to seek help in a timely way</h2>
        <p class="coreParagraph"> When I get stuck, I will look back on previous resources,  research for more information online or check the relevant threads in discord because there might be someone who already asked the same query. If I still don’t get it, I will ask my fellow classmates and facilitators for help. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>          
        <h2 class="coreHeading"> What I expect from my facilitators</h2>
        <p class="coreParagraph"> I expect the facilitators to communicate with us and guide us through by having a couple of check-ups or catch-ups to see where we are in our learning. Also to support us by constantly providing feedback on our works.              </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 class="coreHeading"> Scheduling information and other commitments</h2>
        <p class="coreParagraph"> I don’t specifically have a schedule information but as I mentioned above I have a one year old boy under my care. However, at this time my husband is taking care of him most of the time and our parents are also around to give a hand. It’s just that there will be times that I need to attend to my baby, especially that we are still on pure breastfeeding.
